Additionally, the cross annotation should be conducted by another one or two annotators, and you will learn about how to calculate the agreement statistics as a significant characteristic reflecting the quality of a collected dataset.\n","\n","- For part-4, since the human annotation is quite time- and effort-consuming, there are plenty of ways to get silver-labels from automatic labeling to augment the dataset scale, e.g., paraphrasing each text input in different words without changing its meaning. You will use a [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/t5) paraphrase model to expand the training data of sentiment analysis, and evaluate the improvement of data augmentation.\n","\n","For Parts 1 and Part 2, you will need to complete the code in the corresponding `.py` files (`sa.py` for Part 1, `shortcut.py` for Part 2). You will be provided with the function descriptions and detailed instructions about the code snippet you need to write.\n","\n","\n","### Table of Contents\n","- **PART 1: Sentiment Analysis (33 pts)**\n","    - 1.1 Dataset Processing (10 pts)\n","    - 1.2 Model Training and Evaluation (18 pts)\n","    - 1.3 Fine-Grained Validation (5 pts)\n","- **PART 2: Identify Model Shortcuts (22 pts)**\n","    - 2.1 N-gram Pattern Extraction (6 pts)\n","    - 2.2 Distill Potentially Useful Patterns (8 pts)\n","    - 2.3 Case Study (8 pts)\n","- **PART 3: Annotate New Data (25 pts)**\n","    - 3.1 Write an Annotation Guideline (5 pts)\n","    - 3.2 Annotate Your Datapoints with Partner(s) (8 pts)\n","    - 3.3 Agreement Measure (12 pts)\n","- **PART 4: Data Augmentation (20 pts)**\n","    - 4.1 Data Augmentation with Paraphrasing (15 pts)\n","    - 4.2 Retrain RoBERTa Model with Data Augmentation (5 pts)\n","    \n","### Deliverables\n","\n","- ✅ This jupyter notebook: `assignment2.ipynb`\n","- ✅ `sa.py` and `shortcut.py` file\n","- ✅ Checkpoints for RoBERTa models finetuned on original and augmented SA training data (Part 1 and Part 4), including:\n","    - `models/lr1e-05-warmup0.3/`\n","    - `models/lr2e-05-warmup0.3/`\n","    - `models/augmented/lr1e-05-warmup0.3/`\n","- ✅ Model prediction results on each domain data (Part 1.3 Fine-Grained Validation): `predictions/`\n","- ✅ Cross-annotated new SA data (Part 3), including:\n","    - `data/<your_assigned_dataset_id>-<your_sciper_number>.jsonl`\n","    - `data/<your_assigned_dataset_id>-<your_partner_sciper_number>.jsonl`\n","    - (for group of 3) `data/<your_assigned_dataset_id>-<your_second_partner_sciper_number>.jsonl`\n","- ✅ Paraphrase-augmented SA training data (Part 4), including:\n","    - `data/augmented_train_sa.jsonl`\n","- ✅ `./tensorboard` directory with logs for all trained/finetuned models, including:\n","    - `tensorboard/part1_lr1e-05/`\n","    - `tensorboard/part1_lr2e-05/`\n","    - `tensorboard/part4_lr1e-05/`\n","\n","### How to implement this assignment\n","\n","Please read carefully the following points. All the information on how to read, implement and submit your assignment is explained in details below:\n","\n","1. For this assignment, you will need to implement and fill in the missing code snippets for both the **Jupyter Notebook `assignment2.ipynb`** and the **`sa.py`**, **`shortcut.py`** python files.\n","\n","2. Along with above files, you need to additionally upload model files under the **`models/`** dir, regarding the following models:\n","    - finetuned RoBERTa models on original SA training data (PART 1)  \n","    - finetuned RoBERTa model on augmented SA training data (PART 4)\n","\n","3. You also need to upload model prediction results in Part 1.3 Fine-Grained Validation, saved in **`predictions/`**.\n","\n","4. You also need to upload new data files under the **`data/`** dir (along with our already provided data), including:\n","    - new SA data with your and your partner's annotations (Part 3)\n","    - paraphrase-augmented SA training data (Part 4)\n","\n","5. Finally, you will need to log your training using Tensorboard. Please follow the instructions in the `README.md` of the **``tensorboard/``** directory.\n","\n","**Note**: Large files such as model checkpoints and logs should be pushed to the repository with Git LFS. You may also find that training the models on a GPU can speed up the process, we recommend using Colab's free GPU service for this. A tutorial on how to use Git LFS and Colab can be found [here](https://github.com/epfl-nlp/cs-552-modern-nlp/blob/main/Exercises/tutorials.md).\n","

Whatever the reason, you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more.  The reason for that is simple--I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white.  And for a television fan like myself, that's the ONLY way to watch the first season. The episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them.  Since I wasn't around in 1965, I'm pretty sure I've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here.  But to me, they're still pretty good.  The theme music, in my opinion, is every bit as good as the second theme, introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966. The one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode.  That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s, and it is consistenly rated, along with Viacom's old blue V of Doom, as the scariest logo in the history of television.  The new Sony outro doesn't pack the same punch. Still, if you liked Jeannie way back when, you'll love it now, especially since you can watch it anytime you like, without commercial interruption\", 'domain': 'dvd', 'label': 'positive'}\n","{'review': 'cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes. again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds....', 'domain': 'electronics', 'label': 'negative'}\n","{'review': 'I purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad.

So imagine my surprise when, after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas, I read the erroneous account of the Children's Crusade of 1212.  I had done research on this topic, so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred.  Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years?  If he had, he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who, when told to turn back by King Philip II, did so.  That ended that crusade.  The other one, led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas, led a group across the Alps into Italy.  Some left for home while others continued on to Rome.  It's interesting to note that in Rome, many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these \"children\" were either too old or because they were pregnant.  Perhaps until relatively recently, people believed in the Children's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred, rather than relying on more contemporary sources.  Nor did they realize that the latin word \"pueri\" used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than  children). In the final analysis, you just can't rely on books like these to really teach you history.  The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it.  If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel's own account of the Children's Crusade on their website, or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History, or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia.  The book gave two pages to this event, and sadly got it completely wrong. For this gross oversight, I am compelled to give it one star.  Readers of history, never just believe what you read - verify\n","Label: negative\n","\n","Review: A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a \"New York Times Best Seller List\" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation. This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson \"Shot heard around the world\" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking \"I really don't care bout this stuff\" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home. I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business. The \"masterful\" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult. Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well. Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the \"The Corrections\" by Franzen or \"The Cold Six Thousand\" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end. Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.\n","Label: negative\n","\n","Review: I was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and Ghibli Studios previous works.

As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.

So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. \"The Virgin's Lover\" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed.

Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street. But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as \"my work shows that...\" or \"I demonstrated that...\" even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians. One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing! I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces.

But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether. The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway. For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of \"fascism\" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection. And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.) Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. \"The Pragmatics of Patriotism\", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen. Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach. Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the \"great explainer\" is in no danger here. This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long. And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories.

Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway. The setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of \"The Eyre Affair\", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe's \"The Raven\", and it seems they want him back. This a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a \"lost\" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it. There's also the small matter of Thursday's pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursday's role as a \"SpecOps Litratech\", and that whole milieu, she's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of \"Jurisfiction\", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order... Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him. Phew! I've probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea. Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve. It's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he's just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place. I suppose it's all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man's Douglas Adams. The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there's absolutely no narrative tension. All the literary in jokes in the world can't save this shambling wreck, and I don't think I'll be moving on to the next book.\n","Label: negative\n","\n","Review: This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series.

But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures.

Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin's \"Red Terror,\" the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin's purges of the late 30's, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on \"McCarthyism\" and the ghastly \"blacklist.\" They're listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don't believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that's no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over \"McCarthyism,\" the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn't have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps! The Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30's and 40's was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin's mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin's secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin's killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the \"horrors\" of \"McCarthyism.\" While no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her \"hero\" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see \"Mao: The Unknown Story\" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood \"useful idiots\" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet's crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of \"The Motorcycle Diaries,\" a saintly portrayal of Castro's chief executioner Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of \"counter-revolutionaries\" at La Cabana prison, something that's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro. The negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can't refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts. Hollywood was filled with Stalin-worshipping Reds (now Castro-worshipping Pinkos), the Rosenberg's were guilty as charged and Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy. Truth hurts - deal with it!

This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of \"Mississippi Burning\" or the anger and impunity of \"Ghosts of Mississippi\", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade \"Miss Congeniality\" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not \"a powerful film.\" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like \"Mississippis Burning,\" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started.

This variety can help the model learn more general features early on, which are applicable across a broader spectrum of the data.\n","\n","  * **Generalization to Unseen Data**: The augmented data model exhibited higher or similar Macro-F1 scores across epochs compared to the model trained on normal data. Higher Macro-F1 scores suggest **better generalization** to unseen data, possibly because the augmented data introduces the model to a wider range of linguistic variations and sentiment expressions, reducing the model's overfitting on the training set's specific characteristics.\n","\n","  * **Effectiveness in Learning**: The performance improvements with augmented data indicate that augmentation can effectively enhance the model's learning, as seen by the relatively quick achievement of high F1 scores. This suggests that data augmentation can mitigate some of the challenges associated with limited or unbalanced training data. This augmentation can help the model by providing more examples of underrepresented classes **(more balanced data)**.\n","\n","\n","### Three Ways to Improve Data Augmentation\n","\n","1. **Contextual Augmentation**: Add new examples to the training dataset that demonstrate new contexts, new domains for the model to learn from.\n"," Instead of text generation, use more complex techniques to create new sentences that maintain the original sentiment while altering the sentence structure. Techniques like paraphrasing or employing models that understand context can generate more meaningful variations.\n","\n","2. **Adversarial Filtering Algorithms**: To refine the dataset by removing examples that are too simplistic or might encourage shortcut learning, where the model relies on superficial cues rather than understanding the text. Through adversarial filtering, complex examples are prioritized in the training set, encouraging the model to develop more robust learning strategies. This involves identifying and excluding \"easy\" examples that don't contribute to learning complex patterns.\n","\n","\n","3. **Controlled Augmentation**: Construct controlled datasets that test specific dimensions of what we want in the first place By implementing a strategy to ensure that the augmented data does not disproportionately represent certain domains or sentiments. An example to control it is to monitor the distribution of key features in the augmented dataset and adjusting the augmentation process to avoid biases.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M3CIeN_kaOQl"},"source":["<div style=\"padding:15px 20px 20px 20px;border-left:3px solid orange;background-color:#fff5d6;border-radius:
